# Benzo  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spikegrobstein/benzo.png)](https://travis-ci.org/spikegrobstein/benzo)

*Take the edge off when doing (command) lines.*

Wrapping [Cocaine](https://github.com/thoughtbot/cocaine), this library will
greatly simplify building complex and conditional commandline arguments.

This is especially useful when creating wrappers for other commandline tools.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'benzo'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install benzo

## Quickstart Example

Given that you want to make a call to `pg_dump`, but depending on some conditions
in your code, you may want to have certain arguments shown or not shown:

```ruby
    # the state of our app:
    @verbose = true
    @database = 'app_production'
    @file = 'app_prod-dump'

    # build the Cocaine::Commandline with Benzo
    line = Benzo.line('pg_dump', {
      '-v' => @verbose,
      '--schema-only' => @schema_only, # note, @schema_only is nil
      '-f :filename' => @file,
      ':db_name' => @database
    })

    line.run # execute the command
```

Benzo takes 2 arguments: `command` and `options_map`. The command is, like in
`cocaine`, the command you wish to run, and `options_map` is a hash containing
the data necessary to build the commandline arguments.

Any value in the hash that evaluates to `false` (this includes `nil`) will be
omitted from the command.

## How options_map works

`options_map` is a hash that gets processed by `Benzo` to create the
`Cocaine::CommandLine` object. The hash gets iterated over and any values that
evaluate to `false` are discarded, then the keys are concatinated together with
spaces to create the commandline arguments that are passed to `cocaine`. Any
symbols embedded in those strings will be used to build the variables to be
interpolated by `cocaine`.

Given the following `options_map`:

```ruby
{
  '-f :file' => "file.dat",
  "-v" => true,
  "-d" => false,
  ":data" => nil
}
```

The resulting command's arguments will be built as `-f 'file.dat' -v` omitting the
`-d` and `:data` values because the values of the hash evaluated to false.

When `Benzo` looks at the keys, it tries to find a symbol (a string leading with
a `:`). It will then use that as the key for whatever value it points to when
building the commandline. For example, `'-f :file' => 'file.dat'` will set `:file`
to `'file.dat'` when passing it to `cocaine`.

You can also pass a symbol as a key directly to the `options_map`, which will be
passed directly to `cocaine` when building the commandline. This is useful if you
want to use the `Logger` or `:expected_outcodes` facilities in `cocaine`. For
example (modified from one of the `cocaine` examples):

```ruby
line = Benzo.line('/usr/bin/false', {
  :expected_outcodes => [ 0, 1 ]
})

begin
  line.run
rescue Cocaine::ExitStatusError => e
  # => You never get here!
end
```

## Limitations and Gotchas

Benzo 1.0.0 is built against Cocaine 0.3.2. At the time of this release, Cocaine is
in its 0.4.x release. Because of this, some of the behaviors are out of date.

Benzo 2.0.0 will address this and use a completely different interface for
interacting with the commandline.
